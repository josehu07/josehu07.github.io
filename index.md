# About Me

I am a computer science Ph.D. student in the [ADSL lab](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/adsl/) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), advised by [Professor Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/) and [Professor Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/). My research interest lies in **computer systems**, especially in distributed systems and algorithms, operating systems, and cloud storage infrastructure.

My current research focuses on modernizing distributed replication protocols for emerging workloads, such as data-heavy replication and wide-area replication. Previously, I studied file systems and kernel storage stack technologies for new hardware such as persistent memory.

I am working towards graduation this summer, and will join the [S3 team](https://www.amazon.science/tag/amazon-s3) at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) as an Applied Scientist starting August 2025. Looking forward to the journey ahead!

```rust
/// Keep calm & do good research!
impl<CS> Researcher<CS> for Me {
    // TODO: This method is far from complete.
    fn week(
        &mut self,
        pubs: &Vec<Literature<CS>>,
        proj: &mut Project<CS>,
        comm: &mut Discussion<CS>, 
    ) -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
        let learning = pubs.collect()?.study()?;
        let progress = proj.hard_work()?;
        let insights = comm.make()?.summarize()?;
        self.meeting(learning, progress, insights)?;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

If you don't mind wasting a few seconds of your life, take a look at these projects:

- [Summerset](https://github.com/josehu07/summerset): a distributed, replicated, protocol-generic KV-store framework written in async Rust for unified state machine replication (SMR) research purposes.
- [MadKV](https://github.com/josehu07/madkv): template of a well-designed KV-store project series for the distributed systems course at my school. Uses for teaching purposes elsewhere are very welcome.
- [Hux OS kernel](https://github.com/josehu07/hux-kernel): a weekend operating system kernel project built to be minimal and understandable. I documented my development of Hux into a complete set of wiki pages.
- [Garner](https://github.com/josehu07/garner): demonstrating hierarchical validation for optimistic concurrency control (OCC) on a B+-tree database index.
- [Codetective](https://josehu.com/apps/codetective): a client-side WASM app enabling code AI authorship analysis in five clicks.
