I am an undergraduate majoring in computer science at ShanghaiTech University. My interest mostly lies in **computer systems**, especially operating systems, storage systems, parallel/distributed processing, and cloud computing. I always enjoy building practical system frameworks for new and real-world workloads that are not yet efficiently handled.

Becoming a Ph.D. candidate at UW-Madison starting Fall 2020.

```rust
/// Keep calm & do good research!
impl<CS> Researcher<CS> for Me {
    // TODO: This method is far from complete.
    fn new_week(&mut self, paper: CS, project: CS)
        -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
        let report = paper.read()?.summarize()?;
        let progress = project.exec()?;
        println!("Say {} and {} on group meeting",
                 report, progress);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### About Me

I "waste" a lot of time sorting out and structuring my acquired knowledge and skills. This helps me identify the importance of what I am currently doing. You probably have different views on these fields and they may diverge from my understanding - I totally agree.

I know very little about these fields and am always willing to learn, explore, and contribute more.
