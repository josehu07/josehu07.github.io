I am currently interested in *storage systems*, *operating systems*, and *distributed systems* in broad.

I worked with [Prof. Harry Xu](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~harryxu/) as a summer intern on scaling and accelerating graph convolutional networks computation using serverless computing.

I also learned a lot from [Prof. Shu Yin](http://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/2018/0502/c2739a24245/page.htm) during my undergraduate study on optimizing file structures and file systems organization for inherently-structured workload, such as robot operating system message bags and cluster trace logs.

### Conferences

- Working on filling this section up (, hopefully with good content)

### Patents

- <b>A Storage System Management Policy Based on Data Content Locality.</b> CN. Yin, S. and <b>Hu, G.</b>, filed in June 2019. Patent application 201910499391.9. [Patent pending.]
