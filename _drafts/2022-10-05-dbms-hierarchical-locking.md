Described in [this paper]() by Jim Gray et. al, *hierarchical locking* has been a well-studied idea in database management systems (DBMS). Despite its long history, I found the theoretical notion of lock modes less intuitive and a little bit hard to understand upon first encounter. This post tries to distill the core motivations of hierarchical locking, breaks its design down into three pieces, and describes them progressively, to hopefully clarify this beautiful idea.
