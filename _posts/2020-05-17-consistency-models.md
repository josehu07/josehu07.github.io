*Replicated state machine* is a common distributed system design to achieve fault-tolerance against *fail-stops*. *Consistency* among distributed replicas thus arise as a crucial problem. People have defined different levels of consistency models throughout distributed systems research. Some of them are strong and easier to reason about and program with, while others weaken the constraints to pursue higher performance.
