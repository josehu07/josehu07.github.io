# Guanzhou's Personal Website

My personal pages hosted on GitHub Pages. Please access through either of:

## Personal Website Trial Path

1. Self-written raw HTML + CSS: Just learning the basics
2. Google Sites: Simple and highly modularized, but not so flexible
3. GitHub Pages with *Jekyll* and *Liquid*: I love it ðŸ”¥
