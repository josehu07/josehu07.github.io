# Guanzhou's Personal Website

My personal webpage hosted on GitHub Pages. Accessible through either of:

- [https://josehu.com](https://josehu.com)
- [https://guanzhou.hu](https://guanzhou.hu)
- [https://josehu07.github.io](https://josehu07.github.io)

## Personal Website Trial Path

1. Self-written raw HTML + CSS: Just learning the basics
2. Google Sites: Simple and modularized, but not so flexible
3. GitHub Pages with *Jekyll* and *Liquid*: I love it ðŸ”¥
