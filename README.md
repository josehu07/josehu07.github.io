# Guanzhou's Personal Website

My personal webpage hosted on GitHub Pages. Accessible through either of:

- [https://josehu.com](https://josehu.com)
- [https://guanzhou.hu](https://guanzhou.hu)
- [https://josehu07.github.io](https://josehu07.github.io)

## Personal Website Trials

1. Self-written raw HTML + CSS: Just learning the basics
2. Google Sites: Simple and modularized, but not so flexible
3. GitHub Pages with *Jekyll* and *Liquid*: Loving it ðŸ”¥
4. Next step: Rust *Leptos* with *Preline* (*Tailwind* CSS)?

## Development Memo

Dependency prerequisites:

* Ruby toolchain matching `.ruby-version` (through `rbenv` recommended)
* Up-to-date RubyGems (`gem`) package manager
* Run `bundle install` once to install all Gems dependencies

Previewing locally:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Publishing to Github Pages, simply push to GitHub:

```bash
gaa
gcam "commit message"
gp
```
